This Android app leverages **TensorFlow Lite (TFLite)** to provide a lightweight, efficient solution for **pneumonia detection** using a pre-trained **deep learning model** 🤖. Built with **Android Studio**, the app allows users to upload chest X-ray images 📷 directly from their mobile devices for analysis. The core of the app is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model, trained to detect signs of pneumonia by analyzing medical images.

The app is designed to be **simple** and **user-friendly** 🧑‍💻, providing an intuitive interface where users can easily upload images and receive real-time predictions 🔍 about the presence of pneumonia. Once an image is uploaded, the app processes it using the TFLite model and displays the results, showing whether the image is likely to represent a healthy or pneumonia-affected lung 🫁. This fast, on-device processing ensures that the app works without requiring an internet connection 🌐, making it ideal for use in areas with limited access to cloud services.

In addition to its diagnostic function, the app also offers features like image preprocessing 🛠️, result visualization 📊, and a history log 📜 of previously uploaded images for comparison. The app is optimized to run efficiently on a wide range of Android devices 📱, offering accessibility and reliability even on lower-end smartphones.

By integrating **TensorFlow Lite** with **Android Studio**, this app brings cutting-edge **AI** and **machine learning** technology to mobile healthcare 🌟, enabling rapid and accurate pneumonia detection in a portable format. It's a step toward **improving healthcare accessibility** by putting the power of AI in the hands of users, doctors, and healthcare providers alike 🏥, helping to detect pneumonia early and improve patient outcomes.
